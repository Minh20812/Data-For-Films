1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,680
How can I be polite in English?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,560
That&#39;s what Marta wants to know.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,920
How do I know that

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,200
I&#39;m being polite
or having good manners in England?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,040
Obviously, you can say things
like &#39;please&#39; and &#39;thank you&#39;,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,640
but let&#39;s look
at some more ways to be polite.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,360
To be polite in English,
we generally use indirect language,

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,400
as direct language can sound
a bit rude.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,880
What do you want?

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,200
Here are some ways you can be
less direct and more polite.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,880
So, giving opinions.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,160
It can sound a bit rude
to give your opinion in a direct way.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,080
Your presentation was too long.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,600
To be less direct,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,280
use verbs like &#39;reckon&#39;, &#39;feel&#39;, &#39;guess&#39; and
vague language like &#39;a little&#39;, &#39;sort of&#39;,

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,040
&#39;kind of&#39;.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
I reckon your
presentation was a little too long.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,920
You can also turn it
into a question to be more polite.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Don&#39;t you think your presentation
could be a little shorter?

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,480
For requests,

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,200
if you ask them in a direct way,
they can sound a bit rude.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,520
Oh, give me a lift, will you?

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,920
Instead, use modals.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,560
Can you give me a lift, please?

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
Use past or continuous forms,
or even both.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,440
I was wondering if you could possibly
give me a lift to Scotland this weekend?

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,280
You can use question tags.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,000
You couldn&#39;t give me a lift,
could you?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,120
You can also use
introductory phrases like:

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,520
&#39;Would you mind?&#39;

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,400
Would you mind giving me a lift,
please?

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
&#39;When you have time&#39;

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,440
If you have time,

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,840
could you read over this report?

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,320
Saying &#39;no&#39;.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,840
We find it hard
in English to say &#39;no&#39; directly.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
It can sound a bit abrupt.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,480
Are you free Friday night?

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,760
I&#39;m having a party.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,400
Nah.

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,840
Instead, we use unsure and tentative language.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
Use expressions like &#39;I&#39;m not sure&#39;,

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
&#39;I doubt&#39;, &#39;probably&#39;.

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to make it.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,400
And remember,
giving a reason is much more polite.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,000
I think I might be away then.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
When talking about
problems and mistakes,

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,200
if you&#39;re direct, it can make the
other person feel very uncomfortable.

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
My pay is wrong this week.

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
To talk about problems
in a less direct way,

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,360
use verbs like &#39;seem&#39;, &#39;appear&#39;, or &#39;look&#39;.

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Erm, there seems to be a problem
with my pay this week.

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,480
It looks like there&#39;s a
little mistake with my pay this week.

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,640
Or you can use the passive form.

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,760
I think a mistake has been made
with my pay.

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Finally, learn some set phrases
for being polite.

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,400
What?

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,520
Instead of &#39;what?&#39;,

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
&#39;pardon?&#39;

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
Pardon?

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,960
Instead of

62
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,560
&#39;leave me alone&#39;,

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,800
try, &#39;Could I just have a moment, please?&#39;

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Instead of &#39;move&#39;,

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
&#39;Excuse me. Please.&#39;

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Instead of &#39;What do you want?&#39;,

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,080
&#39;Can I help you?&#39;.

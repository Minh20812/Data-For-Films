1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,120
I would say yes. All women, including

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,440
me, know the feeling of being afraid in

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,440
public space.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,800
&gt;&gt; As a woman, you just keep a much closer

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
eye on your surroundings.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,160
&gt;&gt; This man was behind me filming me while

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,920
I was jogging.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,920
&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t. Cut it out.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
&gt;&gt; We live in a society that shrugs its

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
shoulders at the fact that half the

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,879
population can&#39;t move freely in public

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,879
spaces.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,320
The effect of city was tremendous.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,719
Everybody was scared. Police have hunted

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
the hagaman since 1998.

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
&gt;&gt; People had a pair of scissors in their

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,920
jacket. one of the most feared serial

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,920
rapists in the country.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,119
&gt;&gt; Women went to selfdefense classes.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,040
&gt;&gt; Look at me. Hello. I&#39;m talking to you.

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,360
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s the classic. We&#39;d rather send

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,159
women to self-defense courses than talk

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,159
to men about violence.

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,960
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s very important that you listen.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,880
Violence and sexist remarks are their

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,720
easy solution. The model we&#39;re aiming

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,720
for will hurt a bit more.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,720
First question, who knows someone who&#39;s

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,560
experienced some form of sexualized

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,560
violence,

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,159
whether it&#39;s sexual harassment in public

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,159
spaces or anything else?

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,040
The second question, who knows a person

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,040
who has committed sexualized violence?

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,021
Feel free to look around.

36
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,021
[music]

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,720
And then a last question.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
Who knows a person who has committed

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,121
sexualized violence and has been held

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,121
accountable for it? [music]

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
It&#39;s often said that the most dangerous

42
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,239
place for a woman is her own home. It&#39;s

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,160
true domestic violence is rampant and

44
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,720
many women experience violence in their

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,239
relationships. At the same time, we

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,800
mustn&#39;t forget that every woman

47
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,800
experiences violence in public spaces,

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
too.

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,159
&gt;&gt; This man was behind me filming me while

50
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,599
I was jogging.

51
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,280
&gt;&gt; I did not.

52
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,280
&gt;&gt; So, show me again in the deleted folder.

53
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,720
&gt;&gt; I was already heading back when it

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,200
happened. You can imagine a long main

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,680
road on my right. On the left, forest,

56
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
trees, greenery.

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,040
I just come from running around a pond.

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,040
Beautiful water. Just stunning.

59
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,447
[music]

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,879
Then I noticed there was a shadow, a

61
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,480
person on a bicycle about 1 and a half

62
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
meters behind me.

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,760
As a woman, you just keep a much closer

64
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,760
eye on your surroundings.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,640
Then everything happened all at once.

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
Put that away.

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,560
&gt;&gt; I want to check the video is deleted.

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,799
&gt;&gt; Why is it still not deleted?

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,159
&gt;&gt; What?

71
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,159
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s still not deleted. Click on it.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
&gt;&gt; Yes.

73
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,359
&gt;&gt; Why is it still there?

74
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,360
&gt;&gt; Oh man. Delete. Permanently delete this

75
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,360
video.

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Yes.

77
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,520
And back again to the folder to the

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
overview.

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,759
&gt;&gt; Very good. Why do you do that? I don&#39;t

80
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,759
know either.

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don&#39;t usually. Honest.

82
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,600
&gt;&gt; Well, you better never do it again.

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,680
It was pure luck that I had a phone with

84
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,440
me that still had enough battery and

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,960
that I even thought of filming it

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
because most of the time you don&#39;t even

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
notice something like that.

88
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,199
You are filming me while I&#39;m jogging.

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
Luckily, I noticed it cuz I was

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
wondering why there was a shadow behind

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
me.

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,639
It&#39;s bad enough as a woman in this world

93
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,840
and you&#39;re one of the men who makes it

94
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,680
that way.

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,320
When I saw that woman&#39;s video, I thought

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
very brave. The way she reacts to the

97
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
sexual harassment is incredibly

98
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,080
quick-witted.

99
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Her reaction was by the numbers, if you

100
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,720
will. She confronted him, made him

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,400
delete the video.

102
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,320
In reality, it&#39;s hard to react that way.

103
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
A very important message to all those

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,199
affected by sexual harassment in public

105
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,919
spaces is to be aware that any reaction

106
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,919
you have is appropriate.

107
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:43,840
&gt;&gt; [music]

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,919
&gt;&gt; The only inappropriate thing in a

109
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,160
situation like that is the behavior of

110
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,160
the perpetrator.

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,080
My perception of public space is

112
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,840
different because of course every

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,639
negative experience heightens the

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,639
insecurity and skepticism.

115
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,360
One thing I think isn&#39;t talked about

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
enough is public space.

117
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,960
So much more could be done to increase

118
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,960
at least the sense of safety for women.

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
Um has worked with [music] gender

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
equality in urban planning since the

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:33,319
late 1970s and it&#39;s always been an

122
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,319
important focus for the municipality.

123
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:38,960
&gt;&gt; [music]

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,280
&gt;&gt; We have a lot of international attention

125
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,120
and also exchanges with other cities and

126
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,680
of course that&#39;s something that makes us

127
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,840
uh very proud because we think that we

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,840
have done a lot of good things.

129
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:57,949
[music]

130
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,720
So my name is Anika Dalan. I work as a

131
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,440
gender equality officer uh here in the

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,199
municipality of UMIO at the department

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,319
of strategic development. In general, we

134
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,720
know that women as a group feel less

135
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,720
safe in public space than men. So we&#39;re

136
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,160
going to do a little bit of walking in

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,960
the city center and then we&#39;re going to

138
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,280
take the bus up to the So if we

139
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,800
construct places in public space where

140
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,360
people feel unsafe have we know that

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,199
that will disproportionately restrict

142
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,199
women&#39;s movement in public space.

143
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,280
&gt;&gt; This tunnel it&#39;s a walking and bike

144
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,639
passage under the railway.

145
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,280
We know that people feel safer in public

146
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
space in the company of other people and

147
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,440
women feel especially safer in the

148
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,080
company of other women.

149
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,639
There&#39;s an artwork with quotations from

150
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,360
Sara Leadman, which is a local author.

151
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,520
And there&#39;s also recordings of her voice

152
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,840
that you can press and listen to when

153
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,840
you go through.

154
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,039
Even though it&#39;s not an actual physical

155
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,199
woman, but kind of the company of Saleim

156
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:22,199
Man&#39;s words gives a sense of comfort or

157
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,199
security.

158
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,199
You will also see that the corners in

159
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,360
the tunnel are rounded to kind of take

160
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,640
away the feeling that somebody could

161
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,800
hide behind the corner and and jump out.

162
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,959
There&#39;s an exit also in the middle. If

163
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,839
you you feel unsafe, you can also exit.

164
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,760
We sometimes get that question. So now

165
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,720
can you guarantee that nothing will

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,240
happen here? We didn&#39;t build a magical

167
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,080
place. It&#39;s still a place used by human

168
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
beings.

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,440
And we see that people use it a lot. And

170
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,480
that&#39;s the most important factor to

171
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,480
create safety in public space is to have

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
people.

173
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,279
But we need to remember that we also

174
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
simultaneously [music]

175
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,399
have to work with norms and attitudes in

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,399
uh society and how we treat [music] each

177
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,399
other.

We need to remember that women are not

afraid of places. Women are afraid of

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,046
men. [music]

184
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:46,286

185
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000

[music]

189
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,680
&gt;&gt; the case of hog manan really affected

190
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,560
how people in Umo felt about public

191
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:13,240
space

192
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,240
um was a quiet place in 1998

193
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
people locked their cars but on the

194
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,160
countryside everybody didn&#39;t lock their

195
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
house when they got to

196
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay,

197
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
&gt;&gt; this is it.

198
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,959
I don&#39;t know.

199
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,279
&gt;&gt; I work with the Hogaman case in

200
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,440
different magazines, different TV shows.

201
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,147
I&#39;ve been in radio. I wrote a book about

202
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,167
the Hogaman.

203
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,167
&gt;&gt; [music]

204
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,972
&gt;&gt; And so it&#39;s sort of followed me over the

205
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
years.

206
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,720
[music]

207
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,720
So this is the one.

208
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
&gt;&gt; Yes.

209
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:13,360
The Hugman case is special in UMIO. He

210
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,480
was active as far as we know from 1998

211
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,880
to the end of 2005.

212
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Here you can see the escape. He ran

213
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,839
under the bridge. He assaulted about 10

214
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,120
women. It&#39;s been seven years from first

215
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
to last.

216
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,120
&gt;&gt; It was attempted murder.

217
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,760
&gt;&gt; Going out in the evening really scared

218
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
me.

219
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s nothing you can do. As a young

220
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
woman, you feel so unsafe.

221
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,920
It

222
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,800
&gt;&gt; sort of forced a whole city to the knees

223
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,800
for so many years.

224
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,000
We&#39;re at the University of Im. This is

225
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,640
the location where the uh the attack and

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,360
the attempted murder uh in March of 2000

227
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,720
took place. A woman was walking home

228
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,839
from a student pub when she was attacked

229
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:15,680
by Hogaman. He left her to die

230
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,680
unconscious in snow without shoes.

231
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,120
So this is the map of Hoga and this is

232
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,440
the university. The security guard was

233
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,800
on his shift. It was 3:00 in the night.

234
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,800
He was checking doors at the university

235
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,440
and then he suddenly saw something

236
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,440
unusual on the ground.

237
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,160
And when he got closer, he realized

238
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,160
there was a unconscious human being.

239
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,279
She survived

240
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,279
thanks to a security guard.

241
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,880
Then it got quiet

242
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:05,760
for a number of years. It felt like Umo

243
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:09,959
got back to his normal. He was gone

244
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,959
until the end of 2005.

245
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,760
During that time there was a lot of

246
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,639
focus on safety in public space.

247
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,639
You know on things like light but also

248
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,360
things like cutting down bushes.

249
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,800
But gender equality in urban planning is

250
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,800
much more than just safety.

251
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,000
It&#39;s not about individual monsters. It&#39;s

252
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,680
a collective responsibility as well to

253
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,600
make sure that we have a society [music]

254
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,600
where everybody can feel safe.

255
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,279
&gt;&gt; We are Lutan Lousern doesn&#39;t look away.

256
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,680
Lousern citizens standing up for what&#39;s

257
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
right. Our online reporting tool lets

258
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,480
people report sexist and queer hostile

259
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,880
harassment and assault in public spaces.

260
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,720
Our goal to help people feel stronger

261
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,720
when they step in. We don&#39;t look away.

262
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,360
Before anyone hits me, please clap.

263
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,920
That&#39;s the signal for a timeout. As long

264
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,880
as that doesn&#39;t happen, we can keep role

265
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,120
playing. You, the ones who could

266
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,199
possibly intervene, can do whatever

267
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,880
feels spontaneously right to you. Often

268
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,560
people come to our courses saying, &quot;I

269
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,639
witnessed something that upset me, but I

270
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,480
didn&#39;t know what to do. I didn&#39;t dare to

271
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,639
intervene or thought I might have made

272
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,639
it worse.&quot;

273
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,360
&gt;&gt; Is this seat taken?

274
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,670
&gt;&gt; Ciao.

275
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,279
&gt;&gt; Ciao.

276
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,760
[clears throat]

277
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,760
Hello.

278
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
&gt;&gt; Hello.

279
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,360
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m David.

280
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,040
&gt;&gt; You? Are you going to Zurich? What&#39;s

281
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,079
your name?

282
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,600
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not interested in knowing your name.

283
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,839
&gt;&gt; But we&#39;ve seen each other somewhere

284
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,320
before. I think we went to school

285
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,720
together. I have the feeling we know

286
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,959
each other from somewhere.

287
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,880
&gt;&gt; Do you want to have a coffee together?

288
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,880
&gt;&gt; I know a lot of places in Zurich.

289
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,199
Wow. Wow. Wow. What? You&#39;re touching me?

290
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,079
Screw you.

291
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,040
&gt;&gt; She said she&#39;s not interested.

292
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,120
&gt;&gt; Do you know this jerk? Idiot.

293
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,519
&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve often seen in the reporting tool,

294
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,440
I was harassed on the bus. The bus was

295
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,000
full, but no one said anything. No one

296
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,399
helped. That&#39;s where we want to empower

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,040
people to step in and say something to

298
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,040
break their silence.

299
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,360
&gt;&gt; Look at me, not your phone. Is this seat

300
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
still free?

301
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,320
&gt;&gt; Hello. I&#39;m talking to you.

302
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,360
&gt;&gt; Yes, it&#39;s still free.

303
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

304
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,240
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re having an argument right now.

305
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,519
Things aren&#39;t so rosy for us.

306
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,160
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think you two know each other,

307
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,639
do you? No.

308
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,800
&gt;&gt; Could you sit somewhere else?

309
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,399
&gt;&gt; I think you should move.

310
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
&gt;&gt; Are you mother? She can decide for

311
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,880
herself.

312
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,560
&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s really better if you leave.

313
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,279
Who are you? The police or what?

314
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,600
When no one helps, no one steps in, it&#39;s

315
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,680
extremely distressing. You have the

316
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,399
harassment itself and the lack of

317
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,639
societal support. You start wondering,

318
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,720
was that even harassment? Why didn&#39;t

319
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,880
anyone intervene?

320
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,399
It makes you doubt the situation a

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,240
little.

322
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,800
It&#39;s also sending a signal to the

323
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,320
perpetrator. What I&#39;m doing is okay. No

324
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,040
one thought it was worth stepping in at

325
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:57,079
that moment. But we need to show courage

326
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,079
and step up for people.

327
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,279
You came over pretty quickly. Did you

328
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,640
have an impulse or how did you decide

329
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,240
when to come over?

330
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,520
&gt;&gt; I had the impression that you weren&#39;t

331
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,199
responding to her defensive signals.

332
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,439
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s why I sat next to her before

333
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,600
things escalated any further. Mhm.

334
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,240
Often it can make sense to address the

335
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,959
affected person like would you like to

336
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,480
come with me? If you focus on the

337
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,039
aggressor,

338
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,039
things can escalate.

339
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,200
In Lousern, we receive around five

340
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,440
reports per week proportional to their

341
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,919
larger sizes. Zurich and Burn receive

342
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,559
more in a week. They come in practically

343
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,960
every day. And it&#39;s usually reports from

344
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
women experiencing harassment in public

345
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
spaces.

346
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
&gt;&gt; No.

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
&gt;&gt; Why not?

348
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
&gt;&gt; Can you imagine how much courage it

349
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,039
takes to stand here and confront a man

350
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,640
who could physically outmatch me?

351
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,880
&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t do anything to you.

352
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,600
&gt;&gt; Yes, you did. You filmed me while I was

353
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,919
running. Probably my butt. Why?

354
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,400
The fear that harassment could lead to a

355
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,960
physical sexualized assault is always

356
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,720
there. [music]

357
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
You never know what the other person is

358
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,160
capable of.

359
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,320
&gt;&gt; And in this case, of course, it&#39;s a man

360
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,080
you&#39;re up against. When you display

361
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,600
yourself like that,

362
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,600
&gt;&gt; I only saw you from behind.

363
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,720
&gt;&gt; My clothes aren&#39;t an invitation.

364
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,440
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not even into butts.

365
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,360
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t give a

366
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,240
press charges against the man for three

367
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,720
reasons. Number one, he didn&#39;t post the

368
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,919
video publicly. He didn&#39;t forward the

369
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:42,039
video on to anyone in any way.

370
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,039
And three, I was clothed.

371
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,280
&gt;&gt; Why does it have to involve bare skin to

372
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,280
count as sexual assault? That can&#39;t be

373
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
right.

374
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,480
I should be able to run around naked or

375
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,400
dressed in a sack. It shouldn&#39;t matter

376
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
if someone films me with sexual intent

377
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
and even admits to it on video and

378
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,120
audio. I should be able to go to the

379
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,280
police and they should say, &quot;Very good

380
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,640
that you came. We&#39;ll file a report right

381
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,520
away.&quot;

382
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re off then?

383
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,673
&gt;&gt; Yes, I&#39;m going.

384
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,693
&gt;&gt; Good. 3 2 Hurry up now.

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
&gt;&gt; Why are you so aggressive? I didn&#39;t do

387
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,880
anything to you.

388
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,520
&gt;&gt; Because that wasn&#39;t a pleasant

389
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,760
experience. It&#39;ll stay with me all day

390
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,440
and tomorrow and the day after.

391
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
&gt;&gt; Then why do you wear pants like that?

392
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,880
&gt;&gt; Because I&#39;m jogging.

393
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
&gt;&gt; So those are normal pants. Do we really

394
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
want to discuss this?

395
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,400
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry.

396
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,440
&gt;&gt; Ready,

397
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,440
&gt;&gt; set, go.

[music]

399
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,679
&gt;&gt; Ultimately, the question is not if a

400
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,919
woman will experience sexualized

401
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,039
violence,

402
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,039
but when.

403
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,880
For decades, it was the case that

404
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,679
prevention efforts focused almost

405
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,320
exclusively on victims or potential

406
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,160
victims. We looked at women&#39;s behaviors

407
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,679
and what they could do differently.

408
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,600
More than once on my way home, I&#39;ve

409
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,840
pretended to be on the phone or actually

410
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,440
called someone. It&#39;s one of the classic

411
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,440
things you&#39;re taught to do as a girl.

412
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,640
Always keep an eye on your drink when

413
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,400
you&#39;re out. Make sure you don&#39;t drink

414
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
too much.

415
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
There&#39;s advice to follow about clothing,

416
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,039
about behavior, especially behavior

417
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,280
toward men.

418
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,960
You can make a whole list. Carry your

419
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,720
key in your hand so you can use it as a

420
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,559
weapon

421
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,760
or tell someone when you&#39;re leaving,

422
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,520
send me your location, all those things.

423
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
The big problem with that kind of advice

424
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,760
is [clears throat] that it always

425
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,760
includes a form of victim blaming.

426
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
If I grow up believing I have to follow

427
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
certain clothing rules to not be

428
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
sexually harassed and then I don&#39;t

429
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,240
follow them, dress provocatively and end

430
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,000
up being harassed.

431
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,989
Of course, I&#39;d feel like it was my own

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,009
fault.

[music]

434
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,520
Was that really sexual harassment or am

435
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,520
I just being too sensitive?

436
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,120
In that sense, men were relieved of

437
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,760
their responsibility. People said,

438
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,919
&quot;Okay, now we&#39;ll focus on women. Give

439
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,200
them advice so that they hopefully don&#39;t

440
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,280
experience sexual violence.&quot; But

441
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
sexualized violence can only be

442
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,640
prevented by those who commit it, not by

443
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,640
those who experience it.

444
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,039
So far, I&#39;ve only spoken about the

445
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,960
people who are affected. It&#39;s safe to

446
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,600
assume that the vast majority of

447
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,320
perpetrators are men. Regardless of

448
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,480
who&#39;s affected, even men who experience

449
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,120
violence usually experience it at the

450
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,120
hands of other men.

451
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,600
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s enormous potential in working

452
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
with boys. There are so many boys who

453
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,200
have questions and are looking for

454
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
answers.

455
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,799
daycare centers, schools. There are lots

456
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,120
of women there. Boys mostly grow up with

457
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,520
female role models. Then at some point

458
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,520
they realize these are women, but I&#39;m

459
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,520
different.

460
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,559
&gt;&gt; Soccer players are a big thing depending

461
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,320
on where we are. Politicians at the

462
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,655
moment too. Donald Trump comes up

463
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,840
frequently with some boys.

[music] Those

465
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,840
are the kinds of male role models I

466
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,320
often encounter, the ones that take up a

467
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,080
lot of space in our society. That&#39;s why

468
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,600
it&#39;s all the more important for fathers

469
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,600
to serve as positive role models.

470
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,159
Ask fathers, what kind of masculinity do

471
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,919
you present? What kind do you want to

472
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,960
pass on to your children? What kind of

473
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,960
role model do you want to be?

[snorts]

476
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,440
&gt;&gt; There are factors that boys lose during

477
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,440
their socialization.

478
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:36,181
[music]

479
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,320
What emotion am I perceiving? They can

480
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,480
still name that well up to fourth grade.

481
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,480
But if we look six or seven years later,

482
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
unfortunately many have already lost

483
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,000
that. It&#39;s been overridden by societal

484
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,159
expectations of masculinity. They lose

485
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,679
that connection. I believe that&#39;s where

486
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,679
self assertion courses can help.

487
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,120
It&#39;s really important that you listen to

488
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,840
your feelings. Don&#39;t just think, I&#39;m not

489
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,840
going to listen to that.

490
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,200
A self assertion course shouldn&#39;t be

491
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,200
confused with a self-defense course.

492
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
Self assertion means sensing your

493
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,679
boundaries, recognizing them, and

494
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,559
communicating them. It also means

495
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,720
accepting help or offering help. Boys

496
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,960
are often good at giving help. That&#39;s

497
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,880
seen as a masculine trait. But what

498
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,159
starts to get harder, even in fourth

499
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,159
grade, is accepting help.

500
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,200
I think we can really learn something

501
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,039
from these fourth grade boys. Their

502
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,320
wholeheartedness, their carefree

503
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,000
natures, they have a lot of energy.

504
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,919
They come in and take up space very

505
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,279
naturally. That&#39;s nice because they

506
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,279
invest that energy into play.

&gt;&gt; [music]

508
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,200
&gt;&gt; The downside is that they take up space

509
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,360
and forget that others have less because

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,360
of it.

511
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,039
Some of them struggle to take

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
responsibility for their actions.

513
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,520
Meanwhile, girls often take on a lot of

514
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,080
responsibility for the atmosphere in

515
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,080

516
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,000
and Dennis called

517
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,279
Zanti, come to me. You communicated. You

518
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,600
did it. You stood up for another as a

519
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,640

520
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,640
solutions and you succeeded.

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,520
Today at noon, he was arrested on

522
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,080
suspicion of attempted murder. He&#39;s a

523
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Swedish citizen, 33 years old, residing

524
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,720
in the municipality of Umea.

525
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,200
&gt;&gt; The police got a tip that they should

526
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,200
try his DNA.

527
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,640
and he was probably the first one to say

528
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,760
no thanks to to a DNA swab. Uh which

529
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,760
made the police curious.

530
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,600
This is a paper from when he was caught

531
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,320
the day after. It says, &quot;How&#39;s it?&quot; Here

532
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,640
is it. The court ruled him to be in

533
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,200
prison for 14 years. So he was released

534
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,200
after 10 years.

535
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,000
I think that the Hogaman and case really

536
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,120
influenced men and men&#39;s behavior

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,039
towards women.

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,480
It helped to raise awareness of the

539
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,559
perception of how a lot of women feel in

540
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,720
public space and and [music] kind of to

541
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:27,360
create a sense of empathy.

542
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,440
&gt;&gt; Boys aren&#39;t violent by nature. Our

543
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,760
social structure puts boys in a role

544
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,440
where they come to recognize violence as

545
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,440
a legitimate way to enforce their will.

547
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,760
So many feelings are coming up now.

548
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,159
They come up when I watch the video and

549
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,159
talk about it.

550
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,819
I&#39;ve come out of the situation a lot

551
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,720
stronger, though.

00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:01,440

553
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,399
&gt;&gt; The response has been so supportive and

554
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,399
there&#39;s been so much encouragement.

555
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:08,009

556
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,039
To any parents who are worried about

557
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,159
their daughter&#39;s safety, I&#39;d say talk to

558
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,179
your son about it.
